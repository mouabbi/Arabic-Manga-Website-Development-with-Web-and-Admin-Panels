To set up the application, please follow these steps:

1. **Create Database:** Start by creating a database named 'amuramanga'.

2. **Import SQL File:** Once the database 'amuramanga' is created, import the 'amuramanga.sql' file into the newly created database. This file contains the necessary SQL commands to set up the database schema and populate it with initial data. You can typically import the SQL file using tools like phpMyAdmin or by running the SQL script directly from the command line.

3. **Copy Folder to Server:** After setting up the database, copy the entire folder "amuramanga" containing this project files to the 'htdocs' directory of your server. 

The 'htdocs' directory is typically used as the document root for web servers like Apache, and it's where you place your website files to make them accessible via the web browser.

That's it! Your application should now be set up and ready to use. If you encounter any issues, please refer to the documentation or seek assistance from a developer.
